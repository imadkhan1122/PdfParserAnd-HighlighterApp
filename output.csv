The risk indicator assumes you keep your investment in the Portfolio for 5 ,0
years.,0
  This is the recommended holding period for this Portfolio.,0
You may not be able to sell your shares easily or you may have to sell at a price ,1
that significantly impacts on how much you get back.,0
The summary risk indicator (SRI) is a guide to the level of risk of this Portfolio ,0
compared to other investment funds. It shows how likely it is that the Portfolio ,0
will lose money because of movements in the markets.,0
"The Portfolio is classified as 5 out of 7, which is a medium-high risk class.",0
Performance Scenarios,1
What you will get from this share class depends on future market performance. Market developments in the future are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.,0
"The unfavourable, moderate, and favourable scenarios shown are illustrations using the worst, average, and best performance of the share class over the last 10 ",0
years. The scenarios shown are illustrations based on results from the past and on certain assumptions. Markets could develop very differently in the future. The stress ,0
"scenario shows what you might get back in extreme market circumstances, and it does not take into account the situation where we are not able to pay you. If ",0
"applicable, for any periods before the share class activation/reactivation a similar share class proxy was used to replicate expected returns.",0
" For the 5 years unfavourable, moderate, and favourable scenarios the period of returns selected are July 2021 - July 2022, September 2013 - September 2018, ",0

proceeds but you may lose part or all of your investment. You are not covered by the Luxembourg compensation scheme.,0

(CSSF).,0
Last update of the key information document: 10.02.2023,0
What is this product?,1
Type:,1
" As a sub-fund of C&P Funds SICAV, an investment company with variable capital under Luxembourg law, C&P Funds QuantiX is a globally investing ",0
equity fund that is subject to the provisions of the Luxembourg law of 17 December 2010 relating to Undertakings for Collective Investment (UCITS).,0
Objectives:,1
 The objective of the investment strategy is to generate optimal capital growth on investments based on acceptable risk. The investment strategy ,0
uses a series of quantitative analysis techniques. The sub-fund pursues an active investment approach based on the MSCI World in EUR (price index) as ,0
"its benchmark. While the sub-fund strives to have a similar geographical and sector distribution as the benchmark (active weights held at less than 12.5 %), ",0
"a significant part of its investments may not be part of or may have different weightings than the benchmark. Put differently, while the investment manager ",0
"tries to maintain a similar level of risk (ex-ante tracking error below 7 %) as the benchmark, he has the discretion to invest in companies, countries or ",0
sectors not included in the benchmark in order to take advantage of specific investment opportunities and generate alpha. The sub-fund assets are primarly ,0
"invested in shares of issuers located in any country in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania including the Emerging Markets. The sub-fund will ",0
not invest in derivatives neither for investment nor for hedging purposes. The majority of the sub-funds’ total assets - continuously more than 50 % - must be ,0
invested in equity investments according to section 2 (8) of the German Investment Tax Act (»GITA«) (or a respective successor provision). The sub-fund ,0
therefore qualifies as an »equity fund« within the meaning of the GITA.,0
"Unless otherwise decided by the Board of Directors of C&P Funds SICAV, the income of the sub-fund is reinvested, i.e. used to increase the sub-fund ",0
assets and accordingly not distributed. The C&P Funds QuantiX provides no guarantee of positive return or performance. The value of the sub-fund is ,0
directly related to the performance of its investments and is subject to fluctuations that depend primarily on developments on the financial markets. The ,0
"investor bears the full risk of these fluctuations and may not redeem the money invested. In addition, should the investor liquidate the investment early, i.e. ",0
"before the recommended holding period, this may result in the actual risk/return ratio deviating from the indicator below.",0
Intended retail investor:,1
 The C&P Funds QuantiX is aimed at investors who pursue the goal of specific retirement provision or general asset growth / ,0
-optimization and who have a long-term investment horizon of more than 5 years. The C&P Funds QuantiX is also suitable for investors with basic ,0
"knowledge, which can also be obtained through information, e.g. with the help of this document and the sales prospectus. However, investors should be able ",0
"to accept a risk of 4 to 7 and losses up to the total loss of the capital invested. In this respect, the C&P Funds QuantiX does not offer any capital guarantee.",0
Term:,1
 The term of the sub-fund is perpetual but can be terminated at any time as further detailed in the sales prospectus.,0
"The depositary of the sub-fund is Edmond de Rothschild (Europe) with registered offices at 4, rue Robert Stumper, L-2557 Luxembourg.",0
"Further information on the C&P Funds can be obtained free of charge at any time in German, French, English and Dutch from the Management Company ",0
"Creutz & Partners The Art of Asset Management S.A., 18, Duarrefstrooss, L-9944 Beiler, such as the Prospectus, the annual and semi-annual reports as ",0
well as a summary of your investor rights and information on collective redress instruments.,0
"The latest price of the shares is available online at www.edmond-de-rothschild.com, in the »Luxembourg / Institutional & Fund Services / Central ",0
Administration / NAV Centre« section ,0
Shareholders have the right to request conversion of their shares into shares in another sub-fund of the company and to sell their shares on any dealing day ,0

The risk indicator assumes you keep the product for 5 years.,0
Equities and fixed income securities prices may fall under their acquisition ,1
"cost, because of, as examples, development of capital markets or changes in ",0
an issuer situation.,0
"If you sell the investment early, the actual risk may differ significantly and ",0
you may get back less.,0
"Liquidity problems on the capital markets may, under certain circumstances, ",0
affect the purchase and sale of investments of the sub-fund.,0
The sub-fund may fall victim to fraud or other criminal acts. It may also ,0
suffer losses as a result of misunderstandings or errors by employees of the ,0
Management Company or a (sub)depositary or external third parties.,0
The risk indicator helps you to assess the risk associated with the C&P Funds ,0
QuantiX in comparison to other products. The higher the sub-fund is ,0
"ranked on the scale, the greater the potential return, but also the greater the ",0
risk of a loss in value due to certain market developments or because the ,0
sub-fund is unable to pay you out.,0
The sub-fund invests in companies whose business models may be at risk ,0
"from potential negative environmental, social and governance impacts. ",0
These risks may affect the market price of the investment.,0
The risk and reward category was calculated using historical performance data ,1
and it may not be a reliable indicator of the sub-fund’s future risk profile.,0
"This product does not provide protection against future market developments, ",0
so you could lose all or part of the capital invested.,0

What happens if Creutz & Partners The Art of Asset Management S.A. is unable to pay out?,0
"The assets of the sub-fund are segregated from those of Creutz & Partners The Art of Asset Management S.A.. In addition, Edmond de Rothschild (Europe) S.A., ",0
"as depositary (the »Depositary«) of C&P Funds SICAV, is responsible for the safekeeping of the assets of the sub-fund. As such, a possible failure of ",0
Creutz & Partners The Art of Asset Management S.A. would have no immediate financial impact on the sub-fund. The sub-fund‘s assets are kept ,0
"segregated from the Depositary‘s assets, which limits the risk that the sub-fund would suffer a loss in the event of default by the Depositary. There is ",0
no compensation or guarantee mechanism for the shareholders of the sub-fund.,0
What are the costs?,1
"The person advising on or selling you this product may charge you other costs. If so, this person will provide you with information about these costs and ",0

It can help you to assess how the fund has been managed in the past and compare it to its benchmark.,0
Performance is shown after deduction of ongoing charges. Any entry and exit charges are excluded from the calculation.,0
The MSCI World in EUR (price index) is shown as the benchmark. This index version is calculated without taking into account the reinvestment of revenues. ,0

2 Quantifying Fuel-Saving Opportunities from Specific Driving ,0
2.1,0
Savings from Improving Individual Driving Profiles,1
 ,0
2.1.1 Drive Profile Subsample from Real-World Travel Survey ,0
The interim report (Gonder et al. 2010) included results from detailed analyses on five cycles ,0
selected from a large set of real-world global positioning system (GPS) travel data collected in ,0
2006 as part of a study by the Texas Transportation Institute and the Texas Department of ,0
Transportation (Ojah and Pearson 2008). The cycles were selected to reflect a range of kinetic ,0
intensity (KI) values. (KI represents a ratio of characteristic acceleration to aerodynamic speed ,0
and has been shown to be a useful drive cycle classification parameter [O’Keefe et al. 2007].)  ,0
"To determine the maximum possible cycle improvement fuel savings, the real-world cycles were ",0
converted into equivalent “ideal” cycles using the following steps:  ,0
1,0
 ,0
Calculate the trip distance of each sample trip. ,0
2,0
 ,0
Eliminate stop-and-go and idling within each trip.  ,0
3,0
 ,0
Set the acceleration rate to 3 mph/s.  ,0
4,0
 ,0
Set the cruising speed to 40 mph. ,0
5,0
 ,0
Continue cruising at 40 mph until the trip distance is reached. ,0
"To compare vehicle simulations over each real-world cycle and its corresponding ideal cycle, a ",0
midsize conventional vehicle model from a previous NREL study was used (Earleywine et al. ,0
2010). The results indicated a fuel savings potential of roughly 60% for the drive profiles with ,0
either very high or very low KI and of 30%–40% for the cycles with moderate KI values.  ,0
Table 2-1 takes the analysis of these five cycles from the interim report a step further by ,0
examining the impact of the optimization steps one at a time in isolation. As indicated by other ,0
"simulations from the interim report (Gonder et al. 2010), acceleration rate reductions can deliver ",0
"some small fuel savings, but avoiding accelerations and decelerations (accel/decel) altogether ",0
saves larger amounts of fuel. This suggests that driving style improvements should focus on ,0
"reducing the number of stops in high KI cycles, and not just the rate of accelerating out of a stop. ",0

IMPORTANT INFORMATION  ,1
Prospective Investors should read this Memorandum carefully before deciding whether to purchase ,0
Shares in the Fund. Investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk (including the possible loss ,0
"of a substantial part, or even the entire amount, of an investment) and potential conflicts of interest ",0
that prospective Investors should carefully consider before purchasing any Shares. There can be no ,0
"assurance, representation or warranty that the Fund’s investment objectives will be achieved or that ",0
"Investors will receive a return of their capital. In addition, investment results may vary substantially ",0
on a quarterly or annual basis. Investment in the Fund requires the financial ability and willingness to ,0
accept the high risks and lack of liquidity inherent in an investment in the Fund. No one should invest ,0
who cannot afford to lose their entire investment or a significant portion of it. See the “Risk Factors ,0
and Potential Conflicts” section of this Memorandum for a description of the risks of an investment in ,0
the Fund. ,0
Prospective Investors should be aware that the Fund qualifies as a European long-term investment ,0
fund under the ELTIF Regulation which has the objective to raise and channel capital towards Euro-,0
"pean long-term investments in the real economy, in line with the European Union objective of smart, ",0
sustainable and inclusive growth. Long-term investments are typically investments that are of an illiq-,0
"uid nature, require patient capital based on commitments made for a considerable period of time, often ",0
provide late return on investment and generally have an economic profile of a long-term nature. ,0
The Fund is intended to be marketed to both retail and professional investors who qualify as Eligible ,0
Investors within the meaning of the ELTIF Regulation. The Shares may under no circumstances be ,0
"beneficially or legally held or owned by any person, which is not an Eligible Investor. Each prospective ",0
Investor should only invest a small proportion of its overall investment portfolio in the Fund and the ,0
Fund is only suitable for Retail Investors who are able to sustain a long-term and illiquid commitment. ,0
The offering of shares in the Fund does not constitute a direct or indirect offering of interests in any of ,0
"the investments, and purchasers of shares offered hereby will not have any direct interest in or have ",0
"any voting rights in such investments. The investments, or institutions related to the investments, may ",0
"have other business relationships with the Fund, the Board of Directors, the Manager and its affiliates ",0
provided however that compliance with Article 12 of the ELTIF Regulation is ensured.  ,0
"In making an investment decision, prospective Investors must rely on their own examination of the ",0
"Fund and the terms of the offering, including the merits and risks involved. Prospective Investors ",0
"should not construe the contents of this Memorandum as legal, tax, regulatory, financial, investment, ",0
"accounting or other advice, and each prospective Investor is urged to consult with its own advisers ",0
"with respect to legal, tax, regulatory, financial, accounting and other matters concerning an investment ",0
in the Fund. Certain information contained in this Memorandum has been obtained from published ,0
"sources. Neither the Fund, the Manager or any of their directors, officers, employees, agents, profes-",0
sional advisers or its affiliates or any other person assumes any responsibility for the accuracy or ,0

completeness of such information. Shares in the Fund are offered subject to the right of the Board of ,0
Directors to reject any subscription for Shares in whole or in part. In accordance with the requirements ,0
"of the ELTIF Regulation, Retail Investors must however be provided with appropriate investment ad-",0
vice by the distributor before investing. ,0
"In accordance with the ELTIF Regulation and the ELTIF Delegated Regulation, the Fund shall put in ",0
"place facilities available for making subscriptions, making payments to shareholders, repurchasing or ",0
redeeming Shares and shall make available the information the Fund and the Manager are required to ,0
"provide under the ELTIF Regulation. In particular, the Fund shall establish appropriate procedures ",0
and arrangements for dealing with complaints submitted by Retail Investors. The distributor shall ,0
make available facilities to receive investor complaints and shall in particular ensure that investors’ ,0
complaints may be made in one of the official languages of the Retail Investors’ country.  ,0
"The shares of the Fund shall not be advised on, offered or sold to Retail Investors in the EEA without ",0
prior publication of a PRIIPs KID.  ,0
All investors benefit from equal treatment and no preferential treatment or specific economic benefits ,0
are granted to individual investors or groups of investors. ,0
"No person, other than the Board of Directors and the Manager, has been authorised to give information ",0
"or to make any representations other than those contained in this Memorandum, and, if given or made, ",0
such information or representations must not be relied upon as having been authorised. To invest in ,0
"the Fund, each prospective Investor will be required to execute a subscription agreement (which shall ",0
bind the prospective Investor to the Articles and this Memorandum). The information in this Memo-,0
randum is subject to change at any time and the delivery of this Memorandum does not imply that the ,0
information in it is correct as at any time subsequent to the date of this Memorandum. Before the final ,0
"closing of the Fund, the Board of Directors reserves the right to modify any of the terms of the offering ",0
and the Shares described herein. ,0
"The Shares have not been recommended by the CSSF or by any other Governmental, Federal or State ",0
"Securities Commission or Regulatory Authority, nor has any such commission or authority confirmed ",0
the accuracy or determined the adequacy of this Memorandum. The approval of the Fund by the CSSF ,0
does not constitute a recommendation to buy Shares in the Fund. ,0
"If the descriptions in or terms, conditions or other provisions of this Memorandum are inconsistent ",0
"with or contrary to the terms of the Articles then the terms, conditions or other provisions of the Arti-",0
cles will prevail. A copy of the Articles will be furnished to any prospective Investor upon request. ,0
"Each prospective Investor is invited to meet with the Fund’s representatives, to discuss the terms and ",0
"conditions set out in this Memorandum and to obtain any additional information, to the extent that ",0
such representatives possess such information or can acquire it without unreasonable effort or ex-,0
pense. ,0

"Additionally, each prospective Investor will be given the opportunity to ask questions of and receive ",0
answers and additional information from the Manager concerning the offering and other relevant mat-,0
"ters. None of the Fund, the Board of Directors, the Manager or any of the Fund’s advisers are making ",0
any representation or warranty to an Investor regarding the legality of an investment in the Fund by ,0
such Investor or about the income and other tax consequences to them of such an investment. For ,0
"answers to those questions, potential Investors should consult their personal legal counsel and tax ",0
advisers. ,0
"Certain information contained in this Memorandum contains projections, forecasts, targeted returns, ",0
"illustrative returns, estimates, beliefs and similar information (“Forward Looking Information”) that ",0
"can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may”, “will”, “should”, “expect”, ",0
"“anticipate”, “estimate”, “intend”, “continue”, or “believe” or the negatives thereof or other variations ",0
"thereon or comparable terminology. Furthermore, any projections or other estimates in this Memoran-",0
"dum, including estimates of returns or performance, are Forward Looking Information and are based ",0
"upon certain assumptions that may change. Due to various risks and uncertainties, including those set ",0
"forth under the “Risk Factors and Potential Conflicts” section in this Memorandum, actual events or ",0
results or the actual performance of the Fund or its investments may differ materially from those re-,0
"flected or contemplated in such Forward Looking Information. Moreover, actual events are difficult to ",0
"project and often depend upon factors that are beyond the control of the Board of Directors, the Man-",0
ager and their affiliates. Neither the delivery of this Memorandum at any time nor any sale hereunder ,0
shall under any circumstances create an implication that the information contained herein is correct as ,0
of any time after the earlier of the relevant date specified herein or the date of this Memorandum. None ,0
"of the Fund, the Board of Directors, the Manager, the Investment Adviser, their respective affiliates ",0
nor any other person (i) assumes any responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any Forward ,0
Looking Information or (ii) undertakes any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or ,0
revisions to any Forward Looking Information contained herein to reflect any change in their expecta-,0
"tion with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such state-",0
ment is based. Prospective Investors must determine for themselves what reliance (if any) they should ,0
"place on any Forward Looking Information and no responsibility is accepted by the Board of Directors, ",0
"the Manager, the Investment Adviser or their affiliates in respect thereof. ",0
Prospective Investors should be aware that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future ,0
results. The potential for profits also includes the possibility of a loss of all or part of your investment. ,0
"In addition, unless the context otherwise requires, the words “include”, “includes”, “including” and ",0
other words of similar import are meant to be illustrative rather than restrictive.  ,0
"For a description of the types of fees and expenses with respect to the Fund, see the “Terms of the ",0
Fund” section of this Memorandum. Actual realised returns on unrealised investments will depend ,0
"on, among other factors, future operating results, the value of the assets, market conditions at the time ",0
"of disposition, legal and contractual restrictions on transfer that may limit liquidity, any related ",0
January 2022| ,0

"transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may differ from the assumptions and ",0
circumstances on which the valuations used in the performance data contained in this Memorandum ,0
"are based. Accordingly, the actual realised returns on unrealised investments may differ materially ",0
from the returns indicated in this Memorandum. ,0
"In considering the target performance information contained herein, prospective Investors should bear ",0
"in mind that past or targeted performance is not a guarantee, projection or prediction and is not nec-",0
essarily indicative of future results. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve comparable ,0
"results, that targeted returns will be met or that the Fund will be able to implement its investment ",0
strategy and investment approach or achieve its investment objectives. Actual gross and net returns ,0
for the Fund may vary significantly from the targeted returns set forth herein. The Fund’s target re-,0
"turns are expected to be realised from appreciation in the value of the Fund’s investments, the dispo-",0
"sition of investments, operating cash flows and proceeds from borrowings using leverage where the ",0
Manager believes it is appropriate. The target returns stated herein are based on the Manager’s belief ,0
about what returns may be achievable on investments that the Manager intends to pursue in light of ,0
"the Manager’s experience with similar transactions. Further, the target returns stated herein are based ",0
"on an assumption that economic, market and other conditions will not deteriorate and, in some cases, ",0
"improve. The target returns are also based on models, estimates and assumptions about performance ",0
"believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual realised returns on the Fund’s invest-",0
"ments will depend on, among other factors, the ability to consummate attractive investments, future ",0
"operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related ",0
"transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may differ from the assumptions and ",0
circumstances on which the targeted returns are based. ,0
Any Forward Looking Information contained in this Memorandum was prepared by the Manager ,0
without a view necessarily towards public disclosure or compliance or conformity with generally ac-,0
"cepted accounting principles, in each case whether relating to historical, pro forma or other financial ",0
or statistical information or data. ,0
Certain economic and market information contained in this Memorandum has been obtained from ,0
published sources or prepared by other parties and in certain cases has not been updated through the ,0
"date of this Memorandum. In addition, certain information relating to investment performance has ",0
been derived from financial portfolio reports of third parties obtained by the Manager. While Pictet ,0
"believes such sources to be reliable for the purpose used in this Memorandum, Pictet has not updated ",0
any such information through the date hereof or undertaken any independent review of such infor-,0
"mation. None of the Board of Directors, the Manager, the Investment Adviser or any of their directors, ",0

"sentation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the fairness, correctness, accuracy, reasona-",0

to any fluctuation in the rate of exchange between Euros (€) and the currency of the Investor’s home ,0

from an Investor’s investment in the Fund. ,0
The Manager maintains sufficient own funds and professional indemnity insurance to cover its pro-,0

The Manager implements policies and procedures to ensure fair treatment of Investors as required ,0
